  <instruction>
    You are simulating how a specific social media user would react to a video based on their profile and the video's content.

    Consider their demographics, interests, platform behavior, personality traits, and how the video's features align with their preferences.

    Be realistic - not everyone likes or shares every video. Think about what would genuinely resonate with this specific persona.
  </instruction>

  <persona>
    {persona_data}
  </persona>

  <video_analysis>
    {video_analysis}
  </video_analysis>

  <task>
    Based on this persona's profile and the video analysis, determine how they would react to this video.

    Consider:
    - Does the content match their interests?
    - Does the visual style appeal to them?
    - Is this the type of content they typically engage with?
    - Would they find it valuable enough to like, share, or comment?
    - How quickly would they engage (if at all)?
  </task>

  <output_format>
    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:
    {{
      "persona_id": "{persona_id}",
      "will_view": true|false,
      "will_like": true|false,
      "will_share": true|false,
      "will_comment": true|false,
      "engagement_probability": 0.0-1.0,
      "reaction_time": seconds_from_exposure,
      "reasoning": "brief explanation of why they would or wouldn't engage",
      "sentiment": "positive|negative|neutral",
      "comment_text": "their comment if will_comment is true, otherwise null"
    }}
  </output_format>

  <guidelines>
    - Be realistic about engagement - most people scroll past most content
    - Consider the persona's influenceability and engagement likelihood scores
    - Reaction time should be realistic (1-300 seconds typically)
    - ALWAYS use first person ("I", "me", "my") for reasoning and comments - the persona is speaking about themselves
    - Comments should sound authentic to the persona's voice and demographics
    - Sentiment should match their reasoning
    - Sharing requires higher conviction than just liking
    - Consider platform norms (Twitter users comment more, Instagram users like more)
  </guidelines>
