    You are simulating how personas interact with each other about content on {platform}, based on their social network connections and initial reactions.

    This is the critical phase where social influence begins. People who engaged with the content will share it with their network, discuss it, and influence others.

    Model realistic social dynamics:
    - People share content they liked with friends/followers
    - Influence flows through network connections (strong connections = stronger influence)
    - Different connection types behave differently (close friends discuss, followers just see)
    - Timing matters (early engagers can trigger cascades)
    - Platform norms affect behavior
  </instruction>

  <network>
    {network_data}
  </network>

  <initial_reactions>
    {reactions_data}
  </initial_reactions>

  <task>
    Simulate the interactions that would occur between personas based on:

    1. Who engaged with the content initially (liked, shared, commented)
    2. Who they're connected to in the network
    3. Connection strength and type
    4. Platform-specific interaction patterns

    For {platform}:
    - Instagram: Direct shares to stories, DMs to close friends, tags in comments
    - TikTok: Duets, stitches, shares to messaging, "For You" algorithm spread
    - X/Twitter: Retweets, quote tweets, @mentions, thread discussions
    - LinkedIn: Shares to network, comments on posts, professional discussions
    - YouTube: Shares to social media, direct links, recommendations

    IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
    - Generate AT MOST 20-30 key interaction events (not every possible interaction)
    - Focus on the most influential interactions and viral cascades
    - Sample representative interactions rather than modeling every share
    - Keep content field concise (10 words max per event)
    - Maximum 5-8 influence chains
    - Maximum 3-4 propagation stages

    Model:
    - Who shares the content to whom (sample key shares)
    - Conversations/discussions between connected personas (most important ones)
    - Influence chains (A influences B, B influences C) - track key cascades only
    - How content spreads through clusters (high-level overview)
  </task>

  <guidelines>
    - Only people who engaged initially (will_share=true) can share to others
    - Shares primarily go to connected personas (check network edges)
    - Strong connections (0.8-1.0) have higher influence (0.6-0.9)
    - Weak connections (0.1-0.3) have lower influence (0.1-0.4)
    - Close friends discuss content, casual followers just see it
    - When personas communicate (content field), they should speak in first person ("You NEED to see this!", not "persona_001 recommends this")
    - When referencing other personas in interactions, use their names or refer to them by relationship (e.g., "my friend Sarah shared")
    - Influence hubs (high connection count) can trigger viral cascades
    - Timing: Initial reactions happen 0-300s, interactions 300-1800s
    - Not everyone who sees a share will be influenced (realistic engagement rates)
    - Cluster boundaries matter: content spreads easily within clusters, slower across

    Platform-specific interaction rates:
    - Instagram: 15-25% of shares result in target engagement
    - TikTok: 20-35% (algorithm amplifies good content)
    - X/Twitter: 10-20% (noisy feed, harder to stand out)
    - LinkedIn: 20-30% (professional network, high trust)
    - YouTube: 25-40% (trusted recommendations)

  <important>
    - This is where social proof begins to form
    - The network structure determines who can influence whom
    - Not everyone shares to everyone - be selective and realistic
    - Influence strength should correlate with connection strength
    - Some personas will resist influence despite seeing shares (low influenceability)
    - Track the flow of content through the network (propagation stages)

    CRITICAL: Keep your response CONCISE. Limit to 20-30 events maximum.
    Use shorter event IDs (evt_1, evt_2) and concise descriptions.
    The response must be valid, complete JSON that fits within token limits.
