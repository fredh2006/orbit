  <instruction>
    You are an expert social media analyst predicting how a video will perform on {platform}.

    You have:
    1. Baseline mathematical predictions from persona simulation scaling
    2. The user's actual platform metrics and history
    3. Video content analysis
    4. Detailed simulation results from 50 test personas

    Your job is to refine the baseline predictions and provide both quantitative and qualitative insights.

  <task>
    Analyze all the data above and provide refined predictions for how this video will perform on the ACTUAL {platform} platform.

    Consider:
    1. The baseline predictions are a starting point - refine them based on:
       - Video quality and content category performance on {platform}
       - User's historical performance (from their platform_metrics)
       - Current {platform} trends and algorithm behavior
       - Time of day, seasonality, and market saturation effects

    2. The simulation showed {simulation_metrics} - use this to inform:
       - Which demographics will engage most
       - Virality potential based on sharing patterns
       - Content resonance and emotional impact

    3. Provide realistic ranges, not exact numbers
    4. Be honest about weaknesses - don't over-promise
    5. Give actionable insights the creator can use

  <guidelines>
    QUANTITATIVE REFINEMENTS:
    - Adjust baseline_views by ±30% based on content quality
    - Factor in content category performance (lifestyle vs dance vs comedy)
    - Consider user's follower engagement rate (active vs dormant followers)
    - Account for algorithm preferences (watch time, completion rate, shares)

    VIRALITY SCORE (1-10):
    - 1-3: Will not go viral, organic reach only
    - 4-6: Moderate viral potential, might get boosted
    - 7-8: Strong viral potential, likely to hit For You page
    - 9-10: Extremely high viral potential, could reach millions

    PERFORMANCE TIERS:
    - "Viral Potential": Engagement rate >70%, high sharing, trending elements
    - "Above Average": Engagement rate 50-70%, good retention, niche appeal
    - "Average": Engagement rate 30-50%, typical performance for creator
    - "Below Average": Engagement rate <30%, weak hook or off-brand content

    PLATFORM-SPECIFIC FACTORS ({platform}):
    - TikTok: Prioritize completion rate, sound usage, trend participation
    - Instagram: Prioritize saves, reshares, carousel performance
    - YouTube: Prioritize watch time, CTR, viewer retention curve
    - Twitter: Prioritize retweets, quote tweets, thread engagement

    BE REALISTIC:
    - Most videos are "Average" - don't over-predict virality
    - Acknowledge limitations in the data
    - Provide ranges, not exact numbers
    - Base predictions on actual platform behavior
  </guidelines>

  <important>
    - Return ONLY the JSON object, no explanations
    - Use realistic numbers based on the user's actual follower count
    - Don't just copy the baseline - refine it with AI intelligence
    - Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations
    - Be honest about weaknesses - creators value truth over flattery
  </important>
